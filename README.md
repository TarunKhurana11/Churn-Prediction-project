Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses. This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze customer behavior and predict whether they are at risk of churning. The goal is to help businesses reduce churn rates by identifying at-risk customers and taking proactive measures.

🚀 Features
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifies patterns and key features affecting churn.
✅ Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
✅ Multiple Machine Learning Models: Trains models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
✅ Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV for model optimization.
✅ Model Evaluation: Compares performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
✅ Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies key factors driving customer churn.
